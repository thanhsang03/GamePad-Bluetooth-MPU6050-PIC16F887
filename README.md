## Project Name 🚀 
Car Control Handle Using MPU6050 Tilt Sensor via Bluetooth

## Description 📚
This project develops a remote car control handle using the MPU6050 tilt sensor for motion detection and Bluetooth for wireless communication. The control handle allows users to steer the car by tilting the handle in different directions.

## Installation 🛠️
### Hardware Requirements
- MPU6050 tilt sensor
- Bluetooth module (e.g., HC-05 or HC-06)
- Microcontroller PIC16F887 (e.g., Arduino, ESP32)
- Car model or chassis with motors
- Power supply
- Jumper wires and breadboard
### Software Requirements
- CCS Compiler or any compatible programming environment
- Bluetooth communication library
- MPU6050 library
### Steps
